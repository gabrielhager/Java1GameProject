# Adventure Awaits
## This was the project that made me fall in love with programming in Java.
Prior to creating this project, my only experience coding was in C++ and I was struggling to keep up learning the concepts that were so new to me at the time. This project was a cumulative
effort that was updated throughout the semester to result in the final product, a text based RPG game. This is my first project I have ever completed, but it is special to me because of the 
passion it ignited in my heart.
